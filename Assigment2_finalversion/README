I have worked only with a few genes, included in "genesprueba.txt" file. My code is extremely inefficient and it takes a lot of time making the report... 

for running the program: 
$ ruby Assigment2.rb genesprueba.txt output.txt 

(where I put genesprueba.txt, you can include any list of gene you want...) 
I'm sorry for the bad code, I'm new programming and I tried my best.
